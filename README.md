### Installation and Setup





### OVERVIEW
In K-12 education, access to assessment results are crucial for making informed instructional decisions, for reaching struggling students, and for better collaboration among teacher teams.  While proprietary exams often include a suite of reporting tools, teachers are often left with little more than Excel spreadsheets for analyzing the results of their own assessments.  
One important assessment practice is called the Common Formative Assessment which are informal, teacher-created tests that a team of teachers will give uniformly to all of the students that they serve.  The results of these tests help teachers identify students in need of intervention as well as beneficial practices that could be scaled up to all teachers on a team.  
The app Scoring will help teachers by organizing CFA data, then displaying multiple views of the data to better communicate student performance results to stakeholders and to facilitate sounder instructional practices.

### FEATURES
* The user can create class lists and link these lists to other classes that are part of a teaching team. 
* The user can create a CFA report and enter student scores. 
* The user can view different representations of data for a particular CFA, drilling down to include: 
  * A comparison of test results across a teaching team.
  * A comparison of students’ results in one class.
  * Views that identify students with needs for intervention or for enrichment.
  * A view of an individual student’s performance over time.

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Scoring will make use of four technologies: 
* AngularJS for providing the structure for the app’s interactions. 
* Firebase for storing and retrieving data.
* Bootstrap for styling and creating a user interface.
* The D3.js library for creating data visualizations.

### GOALS
The goals of the project are to:
* Solve an authentic problem in the education field. 
* Design a data structure that will be more complex than ones encountered before.
* Plan for a variety of user experiences and create a pleasant and intuitive user interface. 
* Learn a new javascript library independently to expand on skills already acquired.
